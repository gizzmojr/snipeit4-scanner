== Introduction
The purpose of this project was to work around a few current limitations of Snipe-IT using the v4 API. This was done for my own needs, in hopes it gets depricated into future features of Snipe-IT.

It doesn't have to look good, just needs to work. Built with barcode scanner usage in mind, something that adds a CR/LF at the end. 

== Features
* Bulk checking out to user and location
* Bulk updating asset user and location (regardless if checked in/out)
* Bulk checking in assets
* Ability to set next audit date to one year on updating assets
